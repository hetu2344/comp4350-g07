# Core Features

## User Account Management

The user account feature ensures a secure and role-based access system for restaurant staff. Each user (owner, manager, employee) has different permissions based on their role. Managers can track sales and menu changes, while employees see only relevant tools for their job.

## Table Management
The table management feature allows customers to book or cancel reservations, and restaurant staff to modify them as needed. Staff can also view available tables in real time to manage seating effectively.

## Order Management

The Order Management feature allows servers to input and manage orders with accuracy. They can update order statuses, marking them as "In Progress," "Completed," for smooth tracking. This feature provides a structured system for handling orders efficiently, reducing errors and improving overall service management.

## Sales Analysis

The Sales Analysis feature provides real-time insights into daily revenue, allowing restaurant owners to monitor sales performance at a glance. It highlights best-selling menu items, enabling decisions to optimize the menu and maximize profitability. Additionally, it tracks customer preferences, helping owners refine their menu offerings.

## Menu Management

The Menu Management feature allows restaurant managers, owners, or head chefs to customize and update the restaurant's menu as needed. Authorized staff members will have view-only access to assist with order-taking, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. Customers can browse the menu online to view available dishes, prices, and descriptions. 

## Non-Functional Feature

The web application can handle 100 concurrent servers, processing up to 1000 orders per minute
